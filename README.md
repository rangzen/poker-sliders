## Features

- Three sliders for Complexity, Effort, and Uncertainty dimensions
- Interactive table with clickable cells to quickly set values
- Real-time calculation of maximum and mean values
- Standard deviation indicator for value spread
- Simple and intuitive interface (that’s a very personal pref 😁)

## Usage

1. Adjust sliders to set values for each dimension
2. Alternatively, click directly on table cells to set values
3. Use either the maximum value or mean value based on your team's preference

## Maximum Value vs Mean Value: Which to Choose?

### Maximum Value

#### Advantages for maximum value

- Aligns with the principle that a story's complexity is driven by its most challenging aspect
- Better reflects real-world scenarios where a single difficult component often determines the overall complexity
- Helps identify potential bottlenecks early

#### Disadvantages for maximum value

- May obscure the overall scope of the story
- Requires three separate discussions, potentially extending estimation time
- Risk of over-focusing on edge cases during estimation

### Mean Value

#### Advantages for mean value

- Mitigates the impact of outliers across dimensions
- Generally leads to faster consensus
- Provides a balanced view of the story's complexity

#### Disadvantages for mean value

- May underestimate the impact of meaningful combinations of medium values
- Can lead to inflated estimates when one dimension significantly differs from others
- Risk of overlooking critical complexity factors

### Understanding Standard Deviation

The standard deviation indicates how spread out the values are from their mean:

- A low value (close to 0) suggests consistency across all dimensions
- A high value indicates significant variation between dimensions
- A standard deviation of 0 means all values are identical

For example:

- Values [1, 1, 1] → SD = 0 (perfect agreement)
- Values [1, 2, 3] → SD = 0.8 (moderate variation)
- Values [1, 1, 8] → SD = 3.3 (significant disagreement)
